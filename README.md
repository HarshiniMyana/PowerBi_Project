# Title : PowerBi_Project
# COVID-19 Data Analysis 

## Objective
This project analyzes COVID-19 cases and deaths across different WHO regions to understand patterns, trends, and regional disparities.

## Dataset
- **Source**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wg6IiTtk_EJMFiZs77JE3oH4XyxOWHDVk2XIWiNS22E/edit?pli=1&gid=7031384#gid=7031384
- **Key Columns**: Date_reported, Country_code, Country, WHO_region, New_Cases, Cumulative_Cases, New_Deaths, Cumulative_Deaths.

## Process
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Cleaned and transformed raw data for analysis.
   - Added calculated columns like week_number, Month
2. **Visualizations**:
   - Covid-19 Cases and deaths evolved over time in different region.
   - Weekly trends of cases and deaths.
   - Country-wise and region-wise case distribution.
   - Map chart to visualize case intensity.
4. **Insights**:
   - Identified spikes and declines in cases.
   - Highlighted the most affected regions.

## Thought Process
During the project, I focused on:
- Identifying the best way to visualize trends and disparities.
- Ensuring data accuracy through calculated fields.
- Addressing challenges with incomplete data and creating meaningful visuals.
- Balancing clarity and detail in hierarchical visualizations.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For creating visualizations.
- **GitHub**: For sharing project and version control.
